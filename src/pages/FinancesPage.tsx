        <h2>Financing this effort</h2>
        <div>It is our intention to be utterly transparent about our expenses, our funding sources,
          and our financial activities.</div>
        <div>&nbsp;</div>
        <div>At present, this is a volunteer effort ("labor of love"), and we have no ongoing personel expenses.</div>
        <div>We may explore various funding sources, including donations and sponsorships.</div>
        <div>&nbsp;</div>
        <div>We've been developing on the AWS Amplify platform, and our attendant expenses for September 2025 ran $7.18.
          We expect these to rise as we add more content and more users.</div>
        <div>&nbsp;</div>
        <div>So <b>by far</b> our greatest expense has been the acquisition of our domain name(s).
          We are somewhat embarrassed to admit that we  paid $15,921.119 for truthsquad.com
          and $4942.97 for thetruthsquad.com. These were one-time expenses, but
          they were quite steep. We felt that these domain names were worth the cost,
          as they are memorable and directly relevant to our mission.
        </div>
        <div>&nbsp;</div>
        <div>We will be posting our monthly expenses here, as well as any donations or sponsorships we receive.
          We will also post a summary of our annual financial activities, including a breakdown of our expenses
          and funding sources.
        </div>
        <div>&nbsp;</div>

        <div>If this site "takes off" at all, we anticipate begging our patrons for some help.  But for now, please enjoy it wwithout worrying about how it's paid for..</div>
        <div>&nbsp;</div>
        <div>Thank you for your interest and support!</div>
